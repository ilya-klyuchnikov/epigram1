Running Epigram
---------------

These comments assume that you are using a pre-compiled distribution. 
See below for information on compiling the system. 

There is a script in the distributions' root directory, called "epigram"
(on Linux/Unix) or "epigram.bat" (on Windows). Running this will start
XEmacs, which in turn will start Epigram.  See below for comments relevant 
to a particular platform.

The start script takes note of its location on your disk, and uses that 
information to correctly pick up the corresponding Epigram binary and the
various library files. Hence, no further installation is required!



Linux version
-------------

"xemacs" must be available on your path. 


Windows version
---------------

"xemacs" must be available on your path. 



================================================================================
Building Epigram

Type "make" in the distribution's root directory. The Makefiles should work
on Linux/Unix and on Windows under Cygwin. 

This will make the standard version of Epigram. 

The Makefiles assume that you have "ghc" in your path.
